# folderCleanup
Occasionally, someone in my company will ask me to select items from a folder and move them to another folder.  This python script will copy those files from one folder to another based on the values from a dictionary called, keep.  The source folder is called, 'stuff_to_clean' and the destination folder is called, 'cleaned_stuff'.
